Technology is the most useful form of science for the general population. In simple
words, technology is when we take the concepts of science and transform them into
gadgets and devices that are useful to us as human beings. When we look around
us, almost everything is a result of or a form of technology.
For example, the device you are using right now is a form of technology made for
communication, or the refrigerator in your kitchen is a use of science that helps to
keep your food fresh and cool. With these examples, we see how dependent we are
on technology and how important it is for us in our daily lives.
It isn’t easy to imagine our lives without using any form of technology. For the
smallest of communications, we tend to turn to our mobile phones. Even most of the
food we eat is packaged in factories using various technologies. Thus, imagining a
life without technology is impossible. It is not only a fact of life but also a necessity
for all of us.
In fact, the smartphone, that is, a mobile phone which can connect to the internet, is
becoming one of the fastest-growing and most accessible forms of technology
around the world. On a smartphone, you can click photographs, browse the internet,
listen to music, and use social media. With the advent of smartphone technology, the
practical purpose of not only communicating with your friends is met, but also so
many others, as mentioned.
Thus, in today’s world, the importance of technology becomes more and more as the
years pass. Scientists have done so much to advance humans using technology,
and we still have a long way to go.
